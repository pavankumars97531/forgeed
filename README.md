## 📊 Executive Summary

The rapid evolution of Generative AI is reshaping expectations in higher education, yet most university systems remain fragmented—separating academics, wellbeing, and career development into disconnected platforms. Through our Master's Research Project, Team Forge examined this critical gap and identified the core challenge: **students lack a unified, personalized support system that can guide them academically, emotionally, and professionally.**

This fragmentation results in:
- Inconsistent academic performance
- Poor course selection and planning
- Disconnected mental health support
- Limited career preparedness

To address this systemic problem, our team developed **ForgeEd**, an AI-enhanced Learning Management System specifically designed for Saint Louis University. ForgeEd integrates traditional LMS capabilities with advanced GenAI features, including:

✅ **Personalized Tutoring** (SLU GPT) - 24/7 AI academic support  
✅ **AI-Generated Learning Pathways** - 90-day career learning roadmaps  
✅ **Dual-Quiz Assessments** - Career and academic performance tracking  
✅ **Wellbeing Monitoring** - Daily mental health indicators  
✅ **Predictive Analytics** - Early risk detection and intervention  
✅ **Dynamic Recommendations** - Personalized learning and course suggestions  

**Expected Impact:** Improved GPA outcomes, early detection of academic risk, increased student engagement, better career alignment, and reduced faculty workload through intelligent automation.

## 🔍 Problem Context & Stakeholders

### The Challenge
Higher education is undergoing significant transformation as universities attempt to integrate emerging GenAI technologies into traditional academic structures. Despite rapid innovation across learning platforms, most institutions—including Saint Louis University—continue to rely on fragmented systems that separately manage courses, wellbeing services, and career support.

**Core Problem:** Students do not receive integrated, timely, and personalized support across academics, wellbeing, and career development, leading to:
- Irregular academic performance
- Unnecessary stress
- Inefficient course planning
- Limited preparedness for industry roles

### Key Stakeholders

**Students (Primary)**
- Struggle with navigating multiple systems for assignments, grades, and career resources
- Lack actionable insights into academic trajectory and skill gaps
- Need early warning systems and predictive insights for timely intervention

**Faculty Members**
- Face pressure to provide individualized feedback while managing grading and administration
- Have limited visibility into student challenges and engagement patterns
- Cannot deliver targeted support without consolidated data

**Academic Advisors & Program Coordinators**
- Require holistic student views for course selection and progress monitoring
- Currently piece together information manually, increasing workload
- Need data-driven systems for personalized academic planning

**University Administration**
- Aim to enhance retention rates and support student wellbeing
- Lack consolidated dashboards or predictive analytics
- Need resource allocation insights and program-level risk identification

**Industry & Education Partners**
- Expect graduates with strong technical skills, adaptability, and emotional resilience
- Require evidence of career readiness and non-academic growth

## 🔬 Research & Insights

### Industry Trends Identified

Our research highlighted several industry-wide trends relevant to SLU's environment:

1. **GenAI-Driven Adaptive Learning** - Personalized, dynamic learning experiences
2. **AI Copilots for Research & Tutoring** - 24/7 academic support systems
3. **Integrated Dashboards** - Combined academic and wellbeing data visualization
4. **Early-Risk Detection Models** - Proactive student retention strategies
5. **Holistic Student Profiles** - Unified data across academic, social, and emotional dimensions

### Key Findings

- **Existing LMS Limitations:** Current platforms (Canvas, Blackboard, etc.) are primarily administrative—handling assignments, grades, and scheduling—but lack deep personalization and behavioral insights

- **Holistic Data Importance:** Combining academic metrics (GPA, quiz performance, course progress) with wellbeing indicators (motivation, energy, stress, sleep) creates significantly more accurate representations of student experience

- **Early Intervention Value:** Research confirms that academic performance, wellbeing, and engagement are interdependent. Students benefit significantly from early warnings, personalized recommendations, and clear learning pathways

- **Market Demand:** Strong evidence supports demand for adaptive learning tools, mental health-aware systems, and AI-powered academic coaching

## 📚 Lessons Learned & Team Reflection

### Key Takeaways

**1. Complexity of Holistic Systems**
Building a system that truly integrates academic, emotional, and career dimensions is significantly more complex than standalone features. The interconnectedness requires careful data modeling, thoughtful UX design, and comprehensive testing.

**2. Value of User-Centric Design**
Early user research with actual SLU students validated our assumptions but also revealed unexpected needs. Iterative design based on real feedback was crucial to creating a system that resonates with users.

**3. AI Integration Challenges**
While OpenAI's API is powerful, prompt engineering and result validation are non-trivial. We learned the importance of:
- Testing multiple prompts
- Implementing guardrails against inappropriate outputs
- Fallback strategies for API failures
- Cost management through efficient API usage

**4. Data as a Critical Asset**
Quality synthetic data was essential for realistic prototyping. The process of generating realistic student profiles, quiz data, and wellbeing assessments helped us understand the domain deeply.

**5. Ethical Responsibility in EdTech**
Working with student data made ethical considerations paramount. We learned to build privacy-first, validate for bias, and maintain transparency with users about AI decision-making.

### Team Collaboration Insights
- Regular standups and async updates kept everyone aligned
- Clear documentation reduced dependencies between team members
- Code reviews strengthened technical quality
- Design-dev collaboration ensured feasibility of ideas

### Future Recommendations
1. **Expand to Mobile:** Develop native mobile apps for better accessibility
2. **Enhanced Analytics:** Implement more sophisticated ML models for prediction
3. **Peer Learning:** Add collaborative features for study groups
4. **Faculty Dashboard:** Create complementary tools for instructor insights
5. **Integration APIs:** Enable connections with other university systems
6. **Continuous Learning:** Implement feedback loops to improve AI model accuracy over time
